### About
Earn rewards by completing bounties.

### Get started as contributor 

First of you need to link your github profile and wallet. This can be done here https://sandblizzard.one/bridge. **Note**: Since we are testing on devnet you will need to change to using devnet in your wallet when interacting with the dapp. 

Secondly, if you want to solve bounties you will also have to activate your solver account. This can be done here https://sandblizzard.one/reader. WIthin the reader you an also claim your rewards and discover projects that have a bounty issued. 

### Get started as a project

If you have a github project and want anyone to issue bounties in your issues then head over to https://sandblizzard.one/orb to add the Orb github app to your repository. When this is done you can create a bounty by simply writing \$[token]:[amount] \$ e.g. \$ usdc:10 \$ anywhere in your issue. 

## Create bounty

The Orb github app is constantly looking for github issues that contains this pattern \$ [token]:[amount] \$, like \$ usdc:10 \$. The app will then interpret this as an intention to issue a bounty.
