### Why?
There are many solutions out there for project to issue boounties, especially bug bounties. However, there are two problems with the current model

1. Most bounties are large which requires time and dedication to solve. This rules out a lot of smaller contributors.
2. It involves a third party. This increases the communication loop.

Sandblizzard solves both of these by allowing bounties of any size to be posted natively on github. It makes it easy to tap into potential that have a couple of hours here and there. Since the bounty is issues natively it's one entral place for discussion. It also makes it really evident who should get the bounty as the discussion and submission is public. 

### What?
 Sandblizzard allows anyone to attach bounties to github issues. It places a value on issues. This opens up for many different use cases, some are

* Project owner can issue micro bounties that potential contributors can solve in a couple of hours. They can also issue larger bounties which takes longer.
* Users of the project can themselves create issues with bounties if they need the issue to be resolved faster.

### How?
Project owner: Please visit https://sandblizzard.one/orb/ to allow anyone to create bounties in your select repos
Contributors: 
1. Link you github profile and wallet here https://sandblizzard.one/bridge/
2. Activate your solver account https://sandblizzard.one/reader/

If the Orb app is added to the repository a bounty can be created by simply writing 

```
$[TOKEN_NAME]:[AMOUNT]$
```
Somewhere in the issue body.
