✨Magical Internet Bounty✨

### About
Earn rewards by completing bounties.

### How to earn your first ✨Magical Internet Bounty✨ (beta)
> Please note that Sandblizzard is in beta. This means that we are currently using $sandBonk as the bounty. However, $sandBonk is meant to be 1:1 with $bonk on mainnet. If you want to redeem your $bonk then send the $sandBonk to CNY467c6XURCPjiXiKRLCvxdRf3bpunagYTJpr685gPv. You will receive your $bonk shortly thereafter. 

1. Create a Pull Request against the [verification repository](https://github.com/sandblizzard/verification/blob/main/profile.list.json) with your `github user name` and `solanaAddress` like
```js
 {
      "github": <github_user>,
      "solanaAddress": <wallet_address>
    }
```

2. Find an issue in the [rewards repo](https://github.com/sandblizzard/rewards-v1/issues)

3. Solve the issue! If the author mentions you in the closing comment then you have ✨Magical Internet Bounty✨ in your wallet.
