### Why?
There are many solutions out there for project to issue boounties, especially bug bounties. However, there are two problems with the current model

1. Bounties are often large which requires time to solve.
2. It involves a third party. This reduces the issue resolution speed. 

Sandblizzard solves both of these by allowing bounties to be posted natively on github. It makes it easy to tap into talent that have time on the side. 

### What?
 Sandblizzard allows anyone to attach bounties to github issues. This opens up for many different use cases, some of which are

* Project owners can issue micro bounties.
* Users can themselves create bounties if they need an issue to be resolved faster.



### How?
**Builder**: Please visit https://sandblizzard.one/orb/ to allow anyone to create bounties in your select repos

**Contributors**: 
1. Link you github profile and wallet here https://sandblizzard.one/bridge/
2. Activate your solver account https://sandblizzard.one/reader/

If the Orb app is added to a repository a bounty can be created by simply writing 

```
$[TOKEN_NAME]:[AMOUNT]$
```
anywhere in the issue body.
